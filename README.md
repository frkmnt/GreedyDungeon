Procedurally generated roguelite, with mechanics revolving around greed.
The only way to keep your progress with a character is by leaving the dungeon via a portal that appears right before a boss room.
Players must choose between facing the boss with the risk of losing their equipment, or keep their found loot and return to the hub.
The hub allows players to upgrade their characters and purchase permanent upgrades that make the game slightly easier.
To complete the game, players must traverse 100 rooms and defeat the final boss.
